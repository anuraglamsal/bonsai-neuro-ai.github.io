## Research Vision

Our goal is to bring together the "Best Of Neuroscience and AI":

* __What do we mean by the best of neuroscience?__ We look at the brain through the lens of computational cognitive neuroscience: we view the brain as the best known general-purpose information-processor, problem-solver, and learner. Many deep, beautiful, and insightful theories of brain function have been proposed, but none has proven effective at scale.
* __What do we mean by the best of AI?__ Many recent advancements in AI and machine learning are powered by deep neural networks. Machine learning and AI systems just seem to _work at scale_ even if their creators don't fully understand and can't fully control them.

We aim to meet in the middle by

* reverse-engineering principles of efficient inference and learning in the brain
* deriving theories for deep learning that work at scale
