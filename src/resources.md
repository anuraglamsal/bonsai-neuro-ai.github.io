### For current lab members:

* We use [Slack](https://bonsai-lab.slack.com) for most in-lab communication
* Code
	* [Source for this lab website](https://github.com/bonsai-neuro-ai/bonsai-neuro-ai.github.io). Edited collaboratively by everyone.
	* [The `bonsai-nn-library` python package](https://github.com/bonsai-neuro-ai/nn-library) contains useful shared code to use across different projects. Contributions back to the library from lab members are encouraged!
	* [Template/demo project](https://github.com/bonsai-neuro-ai/torch-mlflow-template) illustrating best-practices for setting up a project with PyTorch and MLFlow
* Compute
	* Ask Richard for an account on the lab's shared server to run small/mid-size jobs.
	* Get a research computing account with RIT for larger jobs.

### For prospective PhD students:

We are currently at capacity given funding and not recruiting new PhD students.

### For current RIT students:

* Anyone can get involved by coming to lab meetings, joining the Slack, etc.
* Pathways for BS and MS students to get involved in research include __independent study__, a __capstone project__, or a __thesis project__. An independent study is a deep dive into a topic that is not otherwise covered in another RIT course. The focus is typically on reading to survey some sub-topic in the literature, plus a small amount of coding to replicate existing work / demonstrate understanding. Typically, independent studies do not involve significant original work or research.

	Independent studies are typically arranged about a semester in advance. Topics are always a compromise between student interests and advisor interests, and finding a good topic requires one or two face-to-face meetings with Prof. Lange. An independent study ideally translates to a capstone or thesis project later, but this is not a requirement. Likewise, a capstone or thesis project does not require an independent study first, but it helps.

	Talk to your academic advisor to make a plan, and find more informationa bout IS/Capstone/Thesis tracks on the RIT website.
