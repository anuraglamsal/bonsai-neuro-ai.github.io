### For current lab members:

* We use [Slack](https://bonsai-lab.slack.com) for most in-lab communication
* Math review: we have a work-in-progress internal document for review of linear algebra and probability theory. Request access to the overleaf doc from another lab member.
* Archive of tutorials and lab-teachings: forthcoming/todo
* Code
	* [Source for this lab website](https://github.com/bonsai-neuro-ai/bonsai-neuro-ai.github.io). Edited collaboratively by everyone.
	* [The `bonsai-nn-library` python package](https://github.com/bonsai-neuro-ai/nn-library) contains useful shared code to use across different projects. Contributions back to the library from lab members are encouraged!
	* [Template/demo project](https://github.com/bonsai-neuro-ai/torch-mlflow-template) illustrating best-practices for setting up a project with PyTorch and MLFlow
	* Ask for access to the lab github organization to see other projects/repositories
* Compute
	* Ask Richard for an account on the lab's shared server to run small/mid-size jobs.
	* Consider getting a research computing account with RIT for larger jobs.
